# About the Project

After dining out as a group, going Dutch requires slightly more cognitive effort if everyone orders vastly different types of foods, or if alcohol and non-drinkers are concurrently involved.

A common practice is to calculate the total cost of your own orders. The accuracy then depends on two factors:

1. Remembering what food you ordered
2. Calculating the total amount correctly

If either of these are not fulfilled, it may result in a loss for the person paying upfront. Moreover, it is difficult to keep track of whether every item has been correctly accounted for.

The Bill Splitter allows you to visualise these information line by line, ensuring proper accounting.

# How It Works

A summary table is generated based on the number of pax and number of food items entered. Enter the names and price of all items, and proceed to click the checkbox to assign a specific item to the specific person.

# What Can Be Better?

Stretch goals:

1. Checking more than one checkbox in a row allows the item price to be evenly divided/shared across more than one person.
2. Adding options for GST and service charge tabulations.

# What's Better?

Tablepartners Myriam and Nat shared that [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com/) is a good expenses sharing app, especially for group travels.
